# Password Genorator 
## Description

-The motivation for my to code this project is to see how much information i have learned from the classes and youtube as my second resourse.To test my skills more and more and keep on improving with every project i keep doing.

-The problem that this porjects solves it straight forward. Lets say you have somehting that requres you to have a passcode,for serurity reasons and you cant think of something clever. Matter in fact you want something random since it'll be harder for it to get bypassed, type in how many characters you want the passcode to have if you want Uppersace, Lowercase, Numbers or charchters. It'll generate a password as much times as you need till you like the end result.

-From this project i honestly learned alot since im just learning little by little. From the resourses i have ike the zoom logs and youtube i was able to finish this project and be proud of it.
